# StatUtilsJava 📊

**StatUtilsJava** is a lightweight Java library offering foundational and advanced statistical functions implemented manually — ideal for learning, academic use, or small-scale projects. Built incrementally using pure Java and OOP principles.

---

## 🚀 Features (Implemented)

- ✅ **Mean** — Calculates average for `int[]`, `float[]`, and `double[]`
- ✅ **Median** — Handles both even and odd-length arrays
- ✅ **Mode** — Returns the most frequent element
- ✅ **Variance** — Measures statistical dispersion
- ✅ **Range** — Calculates the difference between max and min
- ✅ **Linear Regression** — Least Squares Method using deviation form:  
   `(x - x̄) = Bxy × (y - ȳ)`
